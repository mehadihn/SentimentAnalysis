The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis "Red" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.




This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.

One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.

I have no idea, why this movie has received such a good rating. It´s an average prison movie without any highlights. Typical Hollywood stuff. There are hundreds of better movies around. The movie drags, the actors are average. It´s just this typical "heartbreaking" stuff and far away from other movies up on this list.





Its good the quality is not great but i would love to watch k return of kings so i must write a review so i finish my porfile






I have seen Shawshank Redemption for more than 10 times and being a critic i have noticed couple of things that really make the movie little dull and listless.It is not to say that the movie is not good. It is pretty good, with all the technical merits - But it doesn't merit a ranking of 9.3 at all. Which is why you can see i rated it pretty low, as compare to God father or God father 2.

One of the factors affecting my rating is the speed of the movie and the plot,it is little diverted and you are not quite sure to understand what the guy is up to. Though curiosity is pretty good in any movie, but this time around curiosity has killed the cat and made the movie little boring.

So in my opinion, Shaw shank Redemption is good but not GREAT.



This film is nothing but one cliche after another. Having seen many of the 100's of prison films made from the early 30's to the 50's, I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those films.

While it is visually well made and acted, the story has every plot point of the "standard" prison film. They have the evil warden, innocent main character, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't waste your time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison genre.
